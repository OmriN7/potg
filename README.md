Overwatch Play of the Game screenshot generator

*master-branch* - Salsa code

*gh-branch* - Distribution code

### TO DO 
* Reuse gulp-uncss
* Use ng-style instead of inline styling
* Implament screen capping option -> Both all of screen and Gyazo "select" type.
* Change user's name to "Drag me"
* Add a font modifier and a color modifier and switch the "x-top" and "x-left"'s.
* Flip vk0 and consider changing the images of the heros to some other images with more potential

### Possibilites for later
* Add a loading animation thing
* Look into inset shadows for the player title (`.dos-string`) https://css-tricks.com/adding-stroke-to-web-text/ 
* Put two nested `ng-repeat`s where possible (left side of the menu)
* Advanced menu with: `font-size`, `color`, direct control of the caption offset and  `background` coordinates config maybe :0
