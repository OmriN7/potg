*master-branch* - Salsa code

*gh-branch* - Distribution code

Warning: as of right now the code is pretty spaghetti all around. Don't use it for reference please.



### to do

#### first
* Reuse gulp-uncss and ignore all the classes that are used inside ng-repeat
* Add my twitter handle thing somewhere
* bg would stop repeating when it would
* Custom images



### Possibilites for later
* Add a loading menu?
* Look into inset shadows for the player title (`.dos-string`) https://css-tricks.com/adding-stroke-to-web-text/
* Make it so that each `label` and `input` don't have to be wrapped around a div'
* Add more a modifier for all of the caption and a modifier to the `font-size`
* Put two nested `ng-repeat`s where possible (left side of the menu)
