Overwatch Play of the Game screenshot generator

*master-branch* - Salsa code

*gh-branch* - Distribution code

Warning: as of right now the code is pretty spaghetti all around. Don't use it for reference please.



### to do

#### first
* ng-repeats with variables that are initiated in ng-init http://jsfiddle.net/HB7LU/4269/ 
* Clean up code by using a controller or whatever (finish the course)
* Reuse gulp-uncss and ignore all the classes that are used inside ng-repeat

#### second
* Add my twitter handle thing somewhere
* For images http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30525536/ng-repeat-images-in-folder
* bg would stop repeating when it would




### Possibilites for later
* Add a loading menu?
* Look into inset shadows for the player title (`.dos-string`)
* Make it so that each `label` and `input` don't have to be wrapped around a div'
* Add more a modifier for all of the caption and a modifier to the `font-size`
