*master-branch* - Salsa code

*gh-branch* - Distribution code

Warning: as of right now the code is pretty spaghetti all around. Don't use it for reference please.



### to do
* Make the hide and show button for  `.menu` look all nice and spin w/ awesomefont
* Look into inset shadows for the player title (`.dos-string`) https://codemyviews.com/blog/inner-shadows-in-css-images-text-and-beyond
* Add a loading menu?
* Add my twitter handle thing somewhere
* Make `.menu` use angularJS to hide and show instead of all of that digustng jquery :Q
* Use `ng-repeat` http://jsfiddle.net/HB7LU/4269/ 
* For images http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30525536/ng-repeat-images-in-folder
* bg would stop repeating when it would
* Reuse gulp-uncss and ignore all the classes that are used inside ng-repeat

### Possibilites for later
* Make it so that each `label` and `input` don't have to be wrapped around a div'
* Add more a modifier for all of the caption and a modifier to the `font-size`
