### to do

* Add a loading menu?
* Add my twitter handle thing somewhere
* Make `.menu` use angularJS to hide and show instead of all of that digustng jquery :Q
* Use `ng-repeat` http://jsfiddle.net/HB7LU/4269/ 
* For images http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30525536/ng-repeat-images-in-folder

### Possibilites for later
