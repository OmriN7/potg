Overwatch Play of the Game screenshot generator

### to do
* Make the hide and show button for  `.menu` look all nice and spin w/ awesomefont
* Look into inset shadows for the player title (`.dos-string`) https://codemyviews.com/blog/inner-shadows-in-css-images-text-and-beyond
* Add a loading menu?
* Add my twitter handle thing somewhere
* Make `.menu` use angularJS to hide and show instead of all of that digustng jquery :Q

### Possibilites for later
* Make it so that each `label` and `input` don't have to be wrapped around a div'
* Add more a modifier for all of the caption and a modifier to the `font-size`
